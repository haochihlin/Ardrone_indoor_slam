# Ardrone_indoor_slam
This repository contains all necessary file to make ARDrone antonomously navigate in indoor environment.

The demo video: https://youtu.be/r9LegSK6MfU

Since this is one of my bachelor project and I have graduated 2 years ago, I can not guarantee that it is still fully functional.
Plus, I don' have an ARDrone to verify it, so I am not planning to write any document about how to reproduce the same experiment.

If you are still interested in this project, please read the "baskets" first.

If you have any question, please use Issue, I will try to find time to answer it.

For any collaboration plan, please send me a email: f44006076@gmail.com
